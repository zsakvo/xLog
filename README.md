### Fast

Blockchain doesn't always mean inefficiency. xLog's efficient caching mechanism and numerous optimisations take it to the peak of performance.

Uses **standard Markdown** with export and import tools and rich APIs for a painless move in and out. All code is **open source** on GitHub, all data is **transparent** on the chain. Domain name, navigation bar, custom styles, all as you wish, and stored on the blockchain.
